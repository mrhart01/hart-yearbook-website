# hart-yearbook-website

This wesbite was created with the collab of Madeline Hart, Nathan Carlilse, and Darby Wallace. We attend Scotts Hill High School. 
Madeline worked on the Meet the Staff and Index as well as the CSS, and JS of all the pages.
Nathan worked on the Calendar and Apply Pages.
Darby worked on the Contact Us and Purchase pages.
Due to the ending of school early, I (Madeline) was responsible for finishing the remainder of our website which included the majority of the styling of the homepage and the creation of the footer as well as the side social media icon bar. 
I (Madeline) took the previous computer course at my school (Computer Science) in which I compteted in the Raspberry Pi competition. Through this course, I found it relatable to the previous course and found that actually creating an aspect of a website by using code was incredible! I furthered my passion for coding and built on the foundation that I had established.
